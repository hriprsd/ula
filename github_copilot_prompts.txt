UI development:
- now once the user enters the role and destination. if the user selects pilot. on the next page he should be able to see that he is offering a ride from home/office to viceversa. with vehicle number, model. location from api response etc.. add suitable icons to it.
- if the user selects passenger. he should be able to see the offers from pilot via the api response which will parse later. now create blocks to show dummy name of user, from location, contact number, vehicle number, etc. with icons the number of offers may vary depending on api response so keep it dynamic
- if its two wheeler also get the remaining details, but show the number of seats to 1 and dont allow user to edit that field for two wheeler
- provide code for passenger dashboard, where there can display multiple ride offer 

API development:

Presentation:

It has pilot and passenger modes. The pilot can specify no of seats, passenger will be displayed a list of names of available pilots that cross the location of the passenger on the way to office. The pilot can also ride as passenger, as there will be option in app to specify if he's pilot or passenger today. Vehicle details if given by the pilot will be displayed to the passenger. The app ui is written in node + vue js, api in node and mysql db. I need not more than 3 slides with precise content
